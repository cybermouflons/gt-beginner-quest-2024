  Play the role of Bob (one of the two parties) in the Diffie-Hellman key
  exchange algorithm to obtain the shared secret!
  
  Then decrypt the encrypted flag that Alice will send to you!

  You don't have to implement the cryptographic algorithms from scratch. Take a look at the
  python crypto library [PyCryptodome](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
  it will help you to decrypt the flag.
