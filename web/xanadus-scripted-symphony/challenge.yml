  Welcome to Xanadu's Scripted Symphony, where harmonious scripts often play a melody of functionality. But beware, for in this symphony, a discordant note lurks. A rogue script, crossing boundaries it shouldn't, can turn the harmonious melody into a cacophony of chaos. Can you spot this cross-site maestro before it takes over the symphony? Listen carefully to the rhythm of the scripts, for sometimes, the most dangerous notes are played from within. Uncover the hidden danger and claim your flag. Remember, in Xanadu's Scripted Symphony, not all scripts play by the rules.
