  Flask Master is the sequel to Baby Flask.

  I always loved being organized, so I decided to create a file manager that will help me keep my files in order. Please, don't mess with my files, I have a lot of important stuff in there! I mean you can't get /flag.txt or anything, right? Execute /readflag to prove me wrong! Can you recover the pin now that the logs are gone?
