Dear Diary,

Today, I made significant progress on the web application I'm developing. I focused on implementing a new feature that allows users to view files securely. It was quite challenging, but I managed to integrate a file view functionality using Flask, a Python web framework.

I started by creating a new route in my Flask app to handle file view requests. I used the `request` object to retrieve the requested file from the request payload.

Next, I implemented a feature to display my uploaded files on the user interface. I used Jinja2 templating engine to dynamically render the file list and provide download links for each file. This way, users can easily access and download their uploaded files.

Overall, I'm pleased with the progress I made today. The file download feature is now functional and secure (I think), enhancing the overall user experience of the web application. Tomorrow, I plan to focus on further refining the user interface and adding additional features, and allow uploads from the web ui.

Until next time,
